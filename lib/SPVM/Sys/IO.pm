SPVM::Sys::IO - IO System Call

=head1 Usage
  
  use Sys::IO;

=head1 Description

C<Sys::IO> is the class for the file IO.

=head1 Class Methods

=head2 mkdir

  static method mkdir : int ($path : string, $mode : int);

mkdir() attempts to create a directory named pathname.

See the detail of the L<mkdir|https://linux.die.net/man/2/mkdir> function in the case of Linux.

See L<Sys::IO::Constant|SPVM::Sys::IO::Constant> about the constant value for the mode.

=head2 rmdir

  static method rmdir : int ($path : string);

rmdir() deletes a directory, which must be empty.

See the detail of the L<rmdir|https://linux.die.net/man/2/rmdir> function in the case of Linux.

=head2 unlink

  static method unlink : int ($path : string);

unlink() deletes a name from the file system. If that name was the last link to a file and no processes have the file open the file is deleted and the space it was using is made available for reuse.

See the detail of the L<unlink|https://linux.die.net/man/2/unlink> function in the case of Linux.

=head2 open

  static method open : int ($path : string, $flags : int, $mode = 0 : int);

Given a pathname for a file, open() returns a file descriptor, a small, nonnegative integer for use in subsequent system calls (read(2), write(2), lseek(2), fcntl(2), etc.). The file descriptor returned by a successful call will be the lowest-numbered file descriptor not currently open for the process.

See the detail of the L<open|https://linux.die.net/man/2/open> function in the case of Linux.

See L<Sys::IO::Constant|SPVM::Sys::IO::Constant> about the constant value for the flags and the mode.

=head2 read

  static method read : int ($fd : int, $buffer : mutable string, $count : int);

read() attempts to read up to count bytes from file descriptor fd into the buffer starting at buf.

See the detail of the L<read|https://linux.die.net/man/2/read> function in the case of Linux.

=head2 write

  static method write : int ($fd : int, $buffer : string, $count : int);

write() writes up to count bytes from the buffer pointed buf to the file referred to by the file descriptor fd.

See the detail of the L<write|https://linux.die.net/man/2/write> function in the case of Linux.

=head2 close

  static method close : int ($fd : int);

close() closes a file descriptor, so that it no longer refers to any file and may be reused. Any record locks (see fcntl(2)) held on the file it was associated with, and owned by the process, are removed (regardless of the file descriptor that was used to obtain the lock).

See the detail of the L<close|https://linux.die.net/man/2/close> function in the case of Linux.

=head2 fopen

  static method fopen : Sys::IO::FileStream ($path : string, $mode : string);

The fopen() function opens the file whose name is the string pointed to by path and associates a stream with it.

See the detail of the L<fopen|https://linux.die.net/man/3/fopen> function in the case of Linux.

The return value is a L<Sys::IO::FileStream|SPVM::Sys::IO::FileStream> object.

=head2 fdopen

  static method fdopen : Sys::IO::FileStream ($fd : int, $mode : string);

The fdopen() function associates a stream with the existing file descriptor, fd. The mode of the stream (one of the values "r", "r+", "w", "w+", "a", "a+") must be compatible with the mode of the file descriptor. The file position indicator of the new stream is set to that belonging to fd, and the error and end-of-file indicators are cleared. Modes "w" or "w+" do not cause truncation of the file. The file descriptor is not dup'ed, and will be closed when the stream created by fdopen() is closed. The result of applying fdopen() to a shared memory object is undefined.

See the detail of the L<fdopen|https://linux.die.net/man/3/fdopen> function in the case of Linux.

The return value is a L<Sys::IO::FileStream|SPVM::Sys::IO::FileStream> object.

=head2 fileno

  static method fileno : int ($stream : Sys::IO::FileStream);

The function fileno() examines the argument stream and returns its integer descriptor.

See the detail of the L<fileno|https://linux.die.net/man/3/fileno> function in the case of Linux.

The file stream is a L<Sys::IO::FileStream|SPVM::Sys::IO::FileStream> object.

=head2 fread

  static method fread : int ($ptr : mutable string, $size : int, $nmemb : int, $stream : Sys::IO::FileStream);

The function fread() reads nmemb elements of data, each size bytes long, from the stream pointed to by stream, storing them at the location given by ptr.

See the detail of the L<fread|https://linux.die.net/man/3/fread> function in the case of Linux.

=head2 feof

  static method feof : int ($stream : Sys::IO::FileStream);

The function feof() tests the end-of-file indicator for the stream pointed to by stream, returning nonzero if it is set. The end-of-file indicator can only be cleared by the function clearerr().

See the detail of the L<getc|https://linux.die.net/man/3/getc> function in the case of Linux.

The file stream is a L<Sys::IO::FileStream|SPVM::Sys::IO::FileStream> object.

=head2 fgets

  static method fgets : string ($s : mutable string, $size : int, $stream : Sys::IO::FileStream);

fgets() reads in at most one less than size characters from stream and stores them into the buffer pointed to by s. Reading stops after an EOF or a newline. If a newline is read, it is stored into the buffer. A terminating null byte (aq\0aq) is stored after the last character in the buffer.

See the detail of the L<fgets|https://linux.die.net/man/3/fgets> function in the case of Linux.

=head2 fwrite

  static method fwrite : int ($buffer : mutable string, $size : int, $data_length : int, $stream : Sys::IO::FileStream);

The file stream is a L<Sys::IO::FileStream|SPVM::Sys::IO::FileStream> object.

=head2 fseek

  static method fseek : int ($stream : Sys::IO::FileStream, $offset : long, $whence : int);

The fseek() function sets the file position indicator for the stream pointed to by stream. The new position, measured in bytes, is obtained by adding offset bytes to the position specified by whence. If whence is set to SEEK_SET, SEEK_CUR, or SEEK_END, the offset is relative to the start of the file, the current position indicator, or end-of-file, respectively. A successful call to the fseek() function clears the end-of-file indicator for the stream and undoes any effects of the ungetc(3) function on the same stream.

See the detail of the L<fseek|https://linux.die.net/man/3/fseek> function in the case of Linux.

The file stream is a L<Sys::IO::FileStream|SPVM::Sys::IO::FileStream> object.

The file stream is a L<Sys::IO::FileStream|SPVM::Sys::IO::FileStream> object.

=head2 fclose

  static method fclose : int ($stream : Sys::IO::FileStream);

The fclose() function flushes the stream pointed to by fp (writing any buffered output data using fflush(3)) and closes the underlying file descriptor.

See the detail of the L<fclose|https://linux.die.net/man/3/fclose> function in the case of Linux.

The file stream is a L<Sys::IO::FileStream|SPVM::Sys::IO::FileStream> object.

=head2 fflush

  static method fflush : int ($stream : Sys::IO::FileStream);

For output streams, fflush() forces a write of all user-space buffered data for the given output or update stream via the stream's underlying write function. For input streams, fflush() discards any buffered data that has been fetched from the underlying file, but has not been consumed by the application. The open status of the stream is unaffected.

See the detail of the L<fflush|https://linux.die.net/man/3/fflush> function in the case of Linux.

=head2 flock

  static method flock : int ($fd : int, $operation : int);

Apply or remove an advisory lock on the open file specified by fd. The argument operation is one of the following:

The directory stream is a L<Sys::IO::DirStream|SPVM::Sys::IO::DirStream> object.

=head2 truncate

  static method truncate : long ($path : string, $offset : long);

The truncate() and ftruncate() functions cause the regular file named by path or referenced by fd to be truncated to a size of precisely length bytes.

umask() sets the calling process's file mode creation mask (umask) to mask & 0777 (i.e., only the file permission bits of mask are used), and returns the previous value of the mask.

See the detail of the L<lseek|https://linux.die.net/man/2/umask> function in the case of Linux.

=head2 rename

  static method rename : int ($old_path : string, $new_path : string);

See the detail of the L<rename|https://linux.die.net/man/2/rename> function in the case of Linux.

=head2 readlink

  static method readlink : int ($path : string, $buffer : mutable string, $buffer_size : int);

readlink() places the contents of the symbolic link path in the buffer buf, which has size bufsiz. readlink() does not append a null byte to buf. It will truncate the contents (to a length of bufsiz characters), in case the buffer is too small to hold all of the contents.

See the detail of the L<utime|https://linux.die.net/man/2/utime> function in the case of Linux.

The buffer is a L<Sys::IO::Utimbuf|SPVM::Sys::IO::Utimbuf> object.

=head2 access

  static method access : int ($path : string, $mode : int);

access() checks whether the calling process can access the file pathname. If pathname is a symbolic link, it is dereferenced.

See the detail of the L<access|https://linux.die.net/man/2/access> function in the case of Linux.

See L<Sys::IO::Constant|SPVM::Sys::IO::Constant> about the constant value for the mode.

=head2 stat

  static method stat : int ($path : string, $stat : Sys::IO::Stat);

These functions return information about a file. No permissions are required on the file itself, but-in the case of stat() and lstat() - execute (search) permission is required on all of the directories in path that lead to the file.

stat() stats the file pointed to by path and fills in buf.

See the detail of the L<stat|https://linux.die.net/man/2/stat> function in the case of Linux.

The stat is L<Sys::IO::Stat|SPVM::Sys::IO::Stat> object.

=head2 lstat

  static method lstat : int ($path : string, $stat : Sys::IO::Stat);

These functions return information about a file. No permissions are required on the file itself, but-in the case of stat() and lstat() - execute (search) permission is required on all of the directories in path that lead to the file.

lstat() is identical to stat(), except that if path is a symbolic link, then the link itself is stat-ed, not the file that it refers to.

See the detail of the L<lstat|https://linux.die.net/man/2/lstat> function in the case of Linux.

The stat is L<Sys::IO::Stat|SPVM::Sys::IO::Stat> object.

  static method fcntl : int ($fd : int, $command : int, $command_arg = undef : object of Int|Sys::IO::Flock|object);

fcntl() performs one of the operations described below on the open file descriptor fd. The operation is determined by cmd.

See the detail of the L<lstat|https://linux.die.net/man/2/fcntl> function in the case of Linux.

The command argument can receive a L<Sys::IO::Flock|SPVM::Sys::IO::Flock> object.

=head2 ioctl

  static method ioctl : int ($fd : int, $request : int, $request_arg_ref = undef : object of Byte|Short|Int|Long|Float|Double|object);

The ioctl() function manipulates the underlying device parameters of special files. In particular, many operating characteristics of character special files (e.g., terminals) may be controlled with ioctl() requests. The argument d must be an open file descriptor.

See the detail of the L<ioctl|https://linux.die.net/man/2/ioctl> function in the case of Linux.

=head2 poll

  static method poll : int ($fds : Sys::IO::PollfdArray, $nfds : int, $timeout : int);

poll() performs a similar task to select(2): it waits for one of a set of file descriptors to become ready to perform I/O.

See the detail of the L<poll|https://linux.die.net/man/2/poll> function in the case of Linux.

The file discritors are a L<Sys::IO::PollfdArray|SPVM::Sys::IO::PollfdArray> object.
